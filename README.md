# nlp-and-sentiment-analysis-project
NLP for hotel review analysis, an assignment for a grad level course in Fall 2019

In this project, I perfromed sentiment analysis of real hotel review data crawled from the
Tripadvisor website using some nlp tools. The purpose of the analysis was to automatically identify positive and negative keywords and phrases associated
with hotels and to better understand characteristics of data analysis tools, extracting explanatory
review summaries, and human reviewing behaviour.

The review data was crawled fro Tripadvisor using the Tripadvisor crawler https://github.com/aesuli/trip-advisor-crawler. 
I chose to do the analysis for the hotels in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada. 

The assignment project contains 5 parts: sentiment analysis and aggregation, frequency analysis, 
mutual information, pointwise mutual information, and general plots.
